# SmartCondominium
Intelligent management system for the electrical energy produced by a condominium of houses. The electrical usage di each house is constantly measured by a smart meter which monitors the use of household appliances. 
The condominium is represented by a peer-to-peer dynamic network aimed at decentralized management of electricity usage. 
Within this network, each house must inform the neighbourhood of its electricity consumption in real time, so that each house can calculate its overall energy consumption. 
In addition, when a house needs to consume more energy than the norm, it must first ask the other houses for their consent so that the total energy consumption of the complex is not exceeded. 
Information on the condominium's power consumption is periodically provided by the houses to a remote server, called the Administrator Server, through which administrators can consult energy consumption to calculate expenses. 
The Administrator Server also allows homes to dynamically add or remove themselves to the condominium's peer-to-peer network.
